# Create a plugin:

When a player exits/enters a certain region, it sends them a message which can be configured in a messages.yml file, admins should be able to add regions either using the world edit API or your own custom wand.

Region data may be stored in either MySQL or MongoDB

The code must be put on GitHub (private or public). If it's private please add my account (`seailz`)
